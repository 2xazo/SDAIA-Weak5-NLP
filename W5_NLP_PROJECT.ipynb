So, I will use some of it here and just add a few points here there, so you know what makes this course really STAND OUT. THIS IS THEEEEE WORST COURSE I have ever taken and the most hated class in 2A for my cohort. The lectures were sooo……….boring and useless, which motivated most of the class to never show up. The textbook is completely useless as well, just pages and pages of conceptual ideas, and then just a bunch of numerical calculations you have no idea how to do. Often, they require you to make wild assumptions or just happen to memorize certain values about a property you would normally look for in a chart. The book barely and I mean barely skims the topic and then it tells you to google the rest for yourself. The tutorials are literally questions from the textbook, which usually does not relate to what it spoke about. The labs were poorly designed; students are sometimes required to buy or search for household items to carry out the experiment. The lab manual always presents a cheap, flimsy experimental setup in the form of a picture with very little organized and comprehensible instruction on how to actually set it up and carry out the procedure, which just of course led to way too many experimental errors, and thus the least accurate data possible. Many large concepts that were repeatedly mentioned throughout the course didn't show up once on the exams. Meanwhile, memorizing random things like the type of material that reading lenses are made of is required for the test. Funnily enough, such random facts, are only shown one time, on this one slide, in this one lecture for a minute. There are even questions on the exam requiring you to use brand-new equations you've never used before, found somewhere on the slides, possibly in the tiniest writing, and with zero explanation as to what each variable in the equation means. So ultimately, even if you manage to self-teach yourself the entire course, you may still get royally screwed. To top it off this teacher will ask you to purchase anything for his class, including software with no notice. Day of the class, prof waltzes in, telling us we need to buy a peer grading software for $30 to submit our assignments, oh and the first assignment, which we were also just hearing about, was due the following day………. the hell! Did you realize that I said, “peer grading software”? So yes, students are marking and evaluating other students’ work and providing feedback to those evaluations. In the end, the prof and Tas will still mark your work and bring down the grade that the students gave you. Thus making this platform a complete waste of your time and money, particularly since there are platforms that other teachers use at this school to do the same thing for free. No surprise that many students were failing his quizzes, especially when there were so few questions on the quiz to do in even lesser time. One question easily translates to 4.5% - 10% of your grade. What makes this better is that for calculation questions, you have to get the EXACT number in order to get the answer correct, so if you have 0.0025 and he has 0.0026, you just lost 10%. Did I mention that if you cumulatively fail the quizzes, you fail the course? He will automatically fail you. All grades aside from the quiz grades become NULL AND VOID, they won’t count towards your final average. So you, my friend would have double wasted your money on that software and all materials you bought for the labs, all the time and effort you spent doing the other course work would have been for nothing. Just in case you are hoping for a curve, get that out of your mind right now. THERE IS NO CURVE, however, you may be selected for an interview where you get 20 mins to make a speech, and/ or be grilled with questions about the different topics that made up the quiz you failed. If you do well on the interview, who knows, you may get 3% added to your failed quiz. This is a one-time thing, so I hope you won't fail more than one quiz and I for sure hope that if you do fail one that it was only like a 47% on that quiz. Enjoy.\", 'label': 'Bad'}\n"
